Run SQL queries on the database to check the performance of optimized queries and indexing strategy.\n        2. Monitor cache hit ratio and query execution plans to ensure proper caching and efficient query processing.\n        3. Verify that connection pooling is working correctly by checking the number of active connections during peak usage periods.\n     - Expected Results: The system should optimize database queries, implement indexes, use a caching layer, and properly handle connections for improved performance and reduced server load.\n\n  6. PROJ-127-TC-006 (Edge Case, High Priority)\n     - Description: Validate error handling in case of timeout or other exceptional scenarios during policy search operations.\n     - Prerequisites: Database setup with optimized queries and indexing strategy, User account with appropriate permissions for policy search.\n     - Test Data Requirements: Sample dataset of policies with various fields populated (policy number, customer name, effective dates, etc.).\n     - Test Steps:\n        1.
